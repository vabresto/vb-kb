## Bio

![Headshot of Alex Petrut](./images/alex-petrut.svg)[^alex-photo-source]

The March 29, 2021 Sports Business Journal item "Labor and Agents" includes metadata stating Alex Petrut was a recent hire at [Stoked Management](../org/stoked-management.md).[^alex-sbj]

A Romanian profile piece about actor Tudor Petruț quotes him describing his son Alexandru as a "manager de sportivi" (sports manager), which aligns with the sports-management context noted above, but this source is non-industry and should be treated as supporting context only.[^alex-click]

## Conversation Notes

- [2026-02-20] Added baseline profile with explicit confidence boundaries: one industry source + one family-background source.

## Changelog

- [2026-02-20]: Created page with sourced sports-agency and family-context notes
