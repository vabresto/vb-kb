# Stoked Management

## Snapshot

- Why this org matters: Historical sports-agency context linked to [Alex Petrut](../person/alex-petrut.md).
- What they do: Sports Business Journal's Labor and Agents issue frames Stoked Management as an expanding agency operation.[^stoked-sbj]
- Best way to approach: Treat this as a relationship node in sports-business talent representation rather than a fully profiled operating platform.

## Bio

A March 29, 2021 Sports Business Journal item titled "Labor and Agents: Taub re-signs 18 clients as Stoked Management expands" includes metadata stating Alex Petrut was a recent hire.[^stoked-sbj]

The current stokedmanagement.com page resolves to a basic "Coming Soon" site from this environment, so operational details remain limited in this pass.[^stoked-site]

## Notes

- [2026-02-20] Added as a supporting org to capture Alex Petrut's documented 2021 sports-agency linkage.

## Changelog

- [2026-02-20]: Created page with available public-source context
