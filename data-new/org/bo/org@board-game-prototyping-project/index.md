# Undisclosed Board Game Prototyping Project

## Snapshot

- Why this org matters: Current exploratory startup direction for [Alice Formwalt](../../../person/al/person@alice-formwalt/index.md).
- What they do: Investigate making high-quality board game materials available in smaller production batches so creators can prototype more easily.
- Best way to approach: Help with supplier access, manufacturing constraints, and validation of demand from independent designers.

## Bio

This page tracks an early concept [Alice Formwalt](../../../person/al/person@alice-formwalt/index.md) is currently exploring: making it easier for others to build board game prototypes by improving access to high-quality materials in smaller quantities.[^boardgame-source]

## Notes

- [2026-02-19] Added from coffee chat follow-up context about current startup exploration.
