# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sat Feb 28 09:59:22 EST 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `KBBaseModel` from `kb.schemas` for new typed configuration models so unknown fields are rejected consistently.
- Keep generated runtime artifacts under `.build/`; the repo already ignores this tree.
- Enrichment source selection should go through `SourceAdapterRegistry.get(...)` so unsupported sources consistently raise `AdapterNotFoundError` instead of ad-hoc `ValueError`s.

## [2026-02-28 10:02:42 EST] - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_config.py` with typed enrichment settings: headless default, run report path, confidence threshold policy, secret-provider policy with env-var fallback, and source-specific settings for `linkedin.com` and `skool.com`.
  - Added `load_enrichment_config_from_env(...)` to apply deterministic environment overrides, including per-source session/evidence paths and secret/env token mappings.
  - Added validation for required supported sources, relative artifact paths, and monotonic confidence thresholds.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_config.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_config.py`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - New schema/config models should inherit from `KBBaseModel` to keep `extra="forbid"` behavior aligned across modules.
    - Artifact defaults should be rooted under `.build/` with deterministic per-source subpaths.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - In this environment, `just check` can fail unless `UV_CACHE_DIR` points to a writable location; use `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache just check`.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - The current quality gate is `just check` (`validate-changed`, `pytest`, then `mkdocs build`).

## Codex Output - Iteration 1 (2026-02-28 10:04:14)
Implemented `US-001` and committed it as `a26c7f0` with message:

`feat: [US-001] - [Add enrichment configuration, confidence policy, and artifact paths]`

Changed files:
- [kb/enrichment_config.py](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/kb/enrichment_config.py)
- [kb/tests/test_enrichment_config.py](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/kb/tests/test_enrichment_config.py)
- [scripts/ralph/prd.json](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/scripts/ralph/prd.json)
- [scripts/ralph/progress.txt](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/scripts/ralph/progress.txt)

Quality checks run:
- `uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q` (passed, `42 passed`)
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache just check` (passed: `validate-changed`, `test`, `site-build`)

PRD/progress updates:
- Set `US-001` to `"passes": true` in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.
- Appended progress entry and added `## Codebase Patterns` in `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.

Branch note:
- I could not create/switch to `ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment` in this environment because writes under `.git/refs/heads` are blocked (`Operation not permitted`), so the commit is currently on `vbrestoiu/feature/structured-data`.

1. If you want the commit on the PRD branch, run:
`git checkout master && git checkout -b ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment && git cherry-pick a26c7f0`

## [2026-02-28 10:08:47 EST] - US-002
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_adapters.py` with a typed source adapter contract covering `authenticate`, `fetch`, `normalize`, and `snapshot`.
  - Added typed request/result models for each adapter phase using `KBBaseModel`.
  - Implemented explicit typed errors for adapter lookup and auth challenges: `AdapterNotFoundError`, `AntiBotChallengeError`, and `MFAChallengeError`.
  - Implemented `SourceAdapterRegistry` with typed registration/lookup and explicit adapter-not-found behavior for unsupported or unregistered sources.
  - Added tests validating contract shape, registry lookup semantics, and typed challenge errors.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_adapters.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_adapters.py`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Treat source selection as a first-class typed operation via `SourceAdapterRegistry` and `SupportedSource` to keep orchestration behavior deterministic.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - In Python enum subclasses, `str(enum_member)` may return `EnumClass.member`; use `.value` for user-facing source identifiers in errors and logs.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - The adapter contract is intentionally transport-agnostic: it can be used by future Playwright adapters without committing to sync vs async orchestration yet.
