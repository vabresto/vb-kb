# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sat Feb 28 09:59:22 EST 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `KBBaseModel` from `kb.schemas` for new typed configuration models so unknown fields are rejected consistently.
- Keep generated runtime artifacts under `.build/`; the repo already ignores this tree.
- Enrichment source selection should go through `SourceAdapterRegistry.get(...)` so unsupported sources consistently raise `AdapterNotFoundError` instead of ad-hoc `ValueError`s.
- Run `lookup_session_state(...)` before authenticated extraction. It returns actionable missing/expired diagnostics and keeps session preflight deterministic.
- Treat malformed session payloads as auth failures by raising typed `AuthenticationError` subclasses before adapter fetch/normalize phases.
- Session bootstrap commands should emit JSON storageState (`cookies` + `origins`) or `{ "storage_state": ... }`; `kb bootstrap-session` injects source/headless/session-path context via `KB_ENRICHMENT_BOOTSTRAP_*` env vars and maps challenge signals to typed MFA/anti-bot errors.

## [2026-02-28 10:02:42 EST] - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_config.py` with typed enrichment settings: headless default, run report path, confidence threshold policy, secret-provider policy with env-var fallback, and source-specific settings for `linkedin.com` and `skool.com`.
  - Added `load_enrichment_config_from_env(...)` to apply deterministic environment overrides, including per-source session/evidence paths and secret/env token mappings.
  - Added validation for required supported sources, relative artifact paths, and monotonic confidence thresholds.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_config.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_config.py`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - New schema/config models should inherit from `KBBaseModel` to keep `extra="forbid"` behavior aligned across modules.
    - Artifact defaults should be rooted under `.build/` with deterministic per-source subpaths.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - In this environment, `just check` can fail unless `UV_CACHE_DIR` points to a writable location; use `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache just check`.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - The current quality gate is `just check` (`validate-changed`, `pytest`, then `mkdocs build`).

Branch note:
- I could not create/switch to `ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment` in this environment because writes under `.git/refs/heads` are blocked (`Operation not permitted`), so the commit is currently on `vbrestoiu/feature/structured-data`.

1. If you want the commit on the PRD branch, run:
`git checkout master && git checkout -b ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment && git cherry-pick a26c7f0`

## [2026-02-28 10:08:47 EST] - US-002
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_adapters.py` with a typed source adapter contract covering `authenticate`, `fetch`, `normalize`, and `snapshot`.
  - Added typed request/result models for each adapter phase using `KBBaseModel`.
  - Implemented explicit typed errors for adapter lookup and auth challenges: `AdapterNotFoundError`, `AntiBotChallengeError`, and `MFAChallengeError`.
  - Implemented `SourceAdapterRegistry` with typed registration/lookup and explicit adapter-not-found behavior for unsupported or unregistered sources.
  - Added tests validating contract shape, registry lookup semantics, and typed challenge errors.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_adapters.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_adapters.py`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Treat source selection as a first-class typed operation via `SourceAdapterRegistry` and `SupportedSource` to keep orchestration behavior deterministic.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - In Python enum subclasses, `str(enum_member)` may return `EnumClass.member`; use `.value` for user-facing source identifiers in errors and logs.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - The adapter contract is intentionally transport-agnostic: it can be used by future Playwright adapters without committing to sync vs async orchestration yet.

## Codex Output - Iteration 1 (2026-02-28 10:10:55)
Implemented `US-002` and committed it.

**What I changed**
- Added typed adapter contract + models + registry + typed errors in [kb/enrichment_adapters.py](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/kb/enrichment_adapters.py)
- Added tests for contract shape, registry behavior, and challenge errors in [kb/tests/test_enrichment_adapters.py](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/kb/tests/test_enrichment_adapters.py)
- Marked `US-002` as passing in [scripts/ralph/prd.json](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/scripts/ralph/prd.json)
- Appended progress entry and updated codebase patterns in [scripts/ralph/progress.txt](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/scripts/ralph/progress.txt)

**Quality checks**
- `uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q` passed (`46 passed`)
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache just check` passed (`validate-changed`, `test`, `site-build`)

**Commit**
- `c0d454f`
- Message: `feat: [US-002] - [Define source adapter contract and registry]`
- Includes tracked pre-existing change in [scripts/ralph/.last-codex-output.md](/Users/victor/ws/vb-kb/scripts/ralph/.last-codex-output.md)

**Branch status**
- Could not create/switch to `ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment` due repo ref lock permission error:
  - `cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment': unable to create directory ...`

There are still stories with `passes: false` in the PRD (11 remaining).

## [2026-02-28 15:18:17 UTC] - US-003
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_sessions.py` with typed session utilities to resolve per-source storageState paths, save/load Playwright storageState JSON, and run preflight lookup with explicit missing/expired diagnostics.
  - Added typed authentication errors for session preflight: `SessionStateMissingError`, `SessionStateExpiredError`, and `InvalidSessionStateError` so invalid session artifacts fail before extraction starts.
  - Added JSON export/import utilities for portable session transfer: `export_session_state_json(...)` and `import_session_state_json(...)`, with source mismatch protection via `SessionTransferPayload`.
  - Added `kb/tests/test_enrichment_sessions.py` covering save/load round trips, missing and expired diagnostics, invalid JSON/shape handling, and export/import source-guard behavior.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_sessions.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_sessions.py`
  - `agents.md`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Session preflight should run through `lookup_session_state(...)` so orchestration can report actionable missing/expired status before adapter execution.
    - Portable session transfer should include source metadata (`source`, `exported_at`, `expires_at`) to prevent importing artifacts into the wrong adapter source.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - `uv` commands in this environment require a writable cache path; use `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache` for tests/checks.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `import_session_state_json(...)` accepts either raw Playwright storageState JSON or the transfer-envelope format, enabling local bootstrap export and headless import workflows without extra conversion steps.

## Codex Output - Iteration 1 (2026-02-28 15:19:32)
Implemented `US-003` on branch `ralph/playwright-kb-enrichment` and committed it.

Commit:
- `7352f57`
- `feat: [US-003] - [Implement session storage plus import/export utilities]`

Changed files:
- [kb/enrichment_sessions.py](/root/ws/vb-kb2/kb/enrichment_sessions.py)
- [kb/tests/test_enrichment_sessions.py](/root/ws/vb-kb2/kb/tests/test_enrichment_sessions.py)
- [scripts/ralph/prd.json](/root/ws/vb-kb2/scripts/ralph/prd.json)
- [scripts/ralph/progress.txt](/root/ws/vb-kb2/scripts/ralph/progress.txt)
- [agents.md](/root/ws/vb-kb2/agents.md)

What was implemented:
- Added per-source Playwright `storageState` save/load utilities.
- Added JSON export/import utilities for portable session transfer.
- Added missing/expired session lookup diagnostics.
- Added typed auth errors for invalid/missing/expired session state before extraction.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for session utilities and transfer flow.

Quality checks run (passed):
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -q` (`54 passed`)
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache just check` (`validate-changed`, `test`, `site-build` all passed)

PRD/progress updates completed:
- Set `US-003` to `"passes": true` in [scripts/ralph/prd.json](/root/ws/vb-kb2/scripts/ralph/prd.json)
- Appended the required progress log entry and updated `## Codebase Patterns` in [scripts/ralph/progress.txt](/root/ws/vb-kb2/scripts/ralph/progress.txt)

There are still stories with `passes: false` (`US-004` onward), so this iteration is complete but not final project completion.

## [2026-02-28 15:34:18 UTC] - US-004
- What was implemented
  - Added `kb/enrichment_bootstrap.py` with typed session-bootstrap orchestration that runs source-specific bootstrap commands, persists Playwright storageState via `save_session_state(...)`, optionally exports transfer JSON, and returns structured bootstrap results.
  - Added challenge-aware bootstrap failure handling with actionable remediation using typed errors (`MFAChallengeError` and `AntiBotChallengeError`), plus explicit errors for missing/invalid bootstrap command output.
  - Added new CLI workflow `kb bootstrap-session <source>` with `--headful` support and automatic headful export path fallback under `.build/enrichment/sessions/<source>/headful-export.json`.
  - Extended enrichment config source settings with optional `bootstrap_command` and env overrides (`KB_ENRICHMENT_LINKEDIN_BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND`, `KB_ENRICHMENT_SKOOL_BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND`).
  - Added `just` targets for the bootstrap workflow: `enrichment-bootstrap` and `enrichment-bootstrap-headful`.
  - Added focused tests for bootstrap orchestration, challenge detection, CLI parsing, and config env overrides.
- Files changed
  - `kb/enrichment_bootstrap.py`
  - `kb/cli.py`
  - `kb/enrichment_config.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_bootstrap.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_cli_bootstrap_session.py`
  - `kb/tests/test_enrichment_config.py`
  - `justfile`
  - `agents.md`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
    - Keep source-specific bootstrap commands in `SourceSettings.bootstrap_command` with env overrides so operators can swap login scripts without code edits.
    - Treat bootstrap command output as a strict JSON contract (`storage_state` envelope or raw storageState object) before persisting sessions.
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
    - CLI headful bootstrap should auto-generate an export path when none is provided so local interactive runs always produce a portable session artifact.
    - Continue using `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache` when running `just check` in this environment.
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
    - `kb bootstrap-session` injects runtime context for bootstrap scripts through `KB_ENRICHMENT_BOOTSTRAP_SOURCE`, `KB_ENRICHMENT_BOOTSTRAP_HEADLESS`, `KB_ENRICHMENT_BOOTSTRAP_SESSION_PATH`, and `KB_ENRICHMENT_BOOTSTRAP_EVIDENCE_PATH`.
