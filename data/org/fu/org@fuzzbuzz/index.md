# Fuzzbuzz

## Snapshot

- Why this org matters: Prior founder context for [Andrei Serban](../../../person/an/person@andrei-serban/index.md) before [Rippling](../../ri/org@rippling/index.md) and [Console](../../co/org@console/index.md).
- What they do: The [Y Combinator](../../yc/org@y-combinator/index.md) company profile describes Fuzzbuzz as "Fuzzing as a Service."[^yc-fuzzbuzz]
- Best way to approach: Treat as historical founder context tied to application-security product work and acquisition outcomes.

## Bio

[Y Combinator](../../yc/org@y-combinator/index.md) lists Fuzzbuzz in the Winter 2019 batch with security/cybersecurity tagging and status marked as acquired.[^yc-fuzzbuzz]

Rippling's acquisition post says the company acquired Fuzzbuzz and names co-founder [Andrei Serban](../../../person/an/person@andrei-serban/index.md).[^rippling-fuzzbuzz]

## Notes

- [2026-02-20] Website field on YC appears effectively blank/defunct in current public profile metadata; this page uses directory and acquisition sources for canonical context.[^yc-fuzzbuzz][^rippling-fuzzbuzz]
