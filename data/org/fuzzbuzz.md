# Fuzzbuzz

## Snapshot

- Why this org matters: Prior founder context for [Andrei Serban](../person/andrei-serban.md) before [Rippling](rippling.md) and [Console](console.md).
- What they do: The [Y Combinator](y-combinator.md) company profile describes Fuzzbuzz as "Fuzzing as a Service."[^fuzzbuzz-yc]
- Best way to approach: Treat as historical founder context tied to application-security product work and acquisition outcomes.

## Bio

[Y Combinator](y-combinator.md) lists Fuzzbuzz in the Winter 2019 batch with security/cybersecurity tagging and status marked as acquired.[^fuzzbuzz-yc]

Rippling's acquisition post says the company acquired Fuzzbuzz and names co-founder [Andrei Serban](../person/andrei-serban.md).[^fuzzbuzz-rippling]

## Notes

- [2026-02-20] Website field on YC appears effectively blank/defunct in current public profile metadata; this page uses directory and acquisition sources for canonical context.[^fuzzbuzz-yc][^fuzzbuzz-rippling]
