# Undisclosed Board Game Prototyping Project

## Snapshot

- Why this org matters: Current exploratory startup direction for [Alice Formwalt](../person/alice-formwalt.md).
- What they do: Investigate making high-quality board game materials available in smaller production batches so creators can prototype more easily.
- Best way to approach: Help with supplier access, manufacturing constraints, and validation of demand from independent designers.

## Bio

This page tracks an early concept [Alice Formwalt](../person/alice-formwalt.md) is currently exploring: making it easier for others to build board game prototypes by improving access to high-quality materials in smaller quantities.[^boardgame-source]

## Notes

- [2026-02-19] Added from coffee chat follow-up context about current startup exploration.

## Changelog

- [2026-02-20]: Created page with linked known-people relationship
