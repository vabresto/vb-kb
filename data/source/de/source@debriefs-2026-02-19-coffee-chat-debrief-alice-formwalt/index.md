### Coffee chat debrief notes: Alice

* **Career interests**

  * Alice is interested in getting exposure to a **product manager–type role**, especially in **games / multimedia** and related areas.
  * She was excited about speaking with someone at **Unity**, potentially around a PM role tied to **interactive AI**.
  * I suggested she talk to **Maguire**, given his **media production background**, and because he may be looking for a **producer** for projects he’s working on.

* **Philosophy / writing**

  * We had an interesting discussion about **philosophy**.
  * She mentioned she **almost completed a philosophy major** but was a few credits short.
  * We discussed her potentially sharing a **dissertation or an essay** she wrote on philosophy.

* **Arts / culture / plans**

  * She mentioned something about **watching a movie together** (I don’t recall which movie or the exact context).
  * We talked a bit about **poetry**—I shared about a **postcard exchange** with a friend where we wrote poems back and forth, and she was interested.

* **Art café outing**

  * We went to an **art café** and each made **clay sculptures**.
  * Alice made a **“goddess of emotion”**—possibly tongue-in-cheek, referencing an earlier **Myers-Briggs** discussion where we both scored high on **intuition and thinking**. Hers had an **arched form** with **Medusa-like snakes**.
  * I made an **“evil plant”** sculpture.

* **Running joke**

  * I joked that I thought she had a background in **military intelligence**; she firmly denied it, and it became a light recurring joke.

## Follow-Up Hooks (Added 2026-02-20)

- Movie plan: We mentioned potentially watching a movie together, so a concrete title/time check-in is a viable next touchpoint.
- Philosophy thread: We discussed philosophy follow-ups including Kierkegaard and Kant; I also mentioned John Lennox as an interesting speaker.
- Relationship signal: There seemed to be a mutual general interest in keeping in touch and overall strong rapport from the conversation.
