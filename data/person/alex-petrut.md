## Bio

![Headshot of Alex Petrut](./images/alex-petrut.svg)[^alex-photo-source]

The March 29, 2021 Sports Business Journal item "Labor and Agents" includes metadata stating Alex Petrut was a recent hire at [Stoked Management](../org/stoked-management.md).[^alex-sbj]

A Romanian profile piece about actor Tudor Petruț quotes him describing his son Alexandru as a "manager de sportivi" (sports manager), which aligns with the sports-management context noted above, but this source is non-industry and should be treated as supporting context only.[^alex-click]
