## Bio

Hearth's official team page lists Misha Tsidulko as CEO.[^hearth-team]

In a company announcement published on October 17, 2022, Misha Tsidulko (identified there as CEO of Hearth) discussed the launch of Hearth's cash-back banking offering in partnership with Marqeta.[^hearth-banking-newswire]

A secondary directory profile on The Org lists prior roles at Enhancify (including Founder and CEO) and includes education details (William & Mary and Stuyvesant High School). That same The Org profile currently labels his Hearth title as Chief of Staff, which conflicts with Hearth's official team page listing him as CEO.[^misha-the-org][^hearth-team]
